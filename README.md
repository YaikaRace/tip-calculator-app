## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework 
- [Vue JS](https://vuejs.org) - JS Framework


### What I learned
I learned how to use events in Vue js and how to make the calculator reactive so that when you type a number and select a tip, the result comes out without having to press any button.

### Continued development
I will keep learning more about Vue JS to keep improving in this amazing Framework.
